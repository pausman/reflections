   Made the difference very clear to see

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So if you go down a rabbit hole you can back out of it

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    Google does it automatically which creates lots of versions rather than a choice when to commit the changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Allows you to choose when to commit at a logical point in the coding process

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log controls the options to view control versions used by git diff. get diff is diff for the version control versions
    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
